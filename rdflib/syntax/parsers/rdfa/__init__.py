RDFa Parser for RDFLib
##########################################

For details on RDFa, the reader should consult the `RDFa syntax document
<http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax>`_.

(Simple) Usage
==============

From a Python file, expecting an RDF/XML pretty printed output::

    >>> from rdflib.graph import Graph
    >>> graph.parse('filename.html', format='rdfa')
    >>> print graph.serialize(format='pretty-xml')

Options
=======

The parser also implements some optional features that are not fully part of
the RDFa syntax. At the moment these are:

- extra warnings and information (eg, missing ``@profile, @version`` attribute
  or DTD, possibly erroneous CURIE:s) are added to the output graph
- possibility that plain literals are normalized in terms of white spaces.
  Default: false. (The RDFa specification requires keeping the white spaces and
  leave applications to normalize them, if needed)
- extra, built-in transformers are executed on the DOM tree prior to RDFa
  processing (see below)

Options are collected in an instance of the :obj:`Options` class and passed to
the processing functions as an extra argument. Eg, if extra warnings are
required, the code may be::

    >>> graph.parse('filename.html', format='rdfa', warnings=True)
    >>> print graph.serialize(format='pretty-xml')

Transformers
============

The package uses the concept of 'transformers': the parsed DOM tree is possibly
transformed before performing the real RDFa processing. This transformer
structure makes it possible to add additional 'services' without distoring the
core code of RDFa processing. (Ben Adida referred to these as "hGRDDL"...)

The user of the package may refer to such and pass them to the parse method via
an the ``transformers`` option. The caller of the package may also add his/her
transformer modules. Here is a possible usage with the 'openid' transformer
added to the call::

    >>> from pyRdfa.transform.OpenID import OpenID_transform
    >>> graph.parse('filename.html', format='rdfa',
    ...     transformers=[OpenID_transform])
    >>> print graph.serialize(format='pretty-xml')

Note that the current option instance is passed to all transformers as extra
parameters. Extensions of the package may make use of that to control the
transformers, if necessary.

HTML5
=====

The `RDFa syntax <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax>`_ is defined in terms of
XHTML. However, in future, `HTML5 <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/>`_ may also be
considered as a carrier language for RDFa. Therefore, the distiller can be
started up in two different modes: - in a "strict" XML mode the input is parsed
by an XML parser (Python's xml minidom), and an exception is raised if the
parser experiences problems - in a "lax" mode, meaning that if the XML parser
has problems, then there is a fallback on an `HTML5 parser
<http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/>`_ to parse the input. This also covers
HTML4 "tag soup" files.

Requires: `html5lib <http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/>`_ for the HTML5
parsing. Note possible dependecies on Python's version on the project's web
site.

SVG 1.2 (and XML host languages in general)
===========================================

The `SVG 1.2 Tiny <http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/>`_ specification has also
adopted RDFa as a means to add metadata to SVG content. This means that RDFa
attributes can also be used to express metadata. There are, however, two subtle
differences when using RDFa with XHTML or with SVG, namely:

- SVG also has a more "traditional" way of adding RDF metadata to a file,
  namely by directly including RDF/XML into SVG (as a child of a ``metadata``
  element. According to the specification of SVG, the graphs extracted from an
  SVG file and originating from such embedded contents and the graph extracted
  via RDFa attributes should be merged to yield the output RDF graph.
- XHTML1 does *not* use the ``xml:base`` functionality, whereas SVG
  (and generic XML applications) do.

By default, the distiller runs in XHTML 'mode', ie, these two extra features
are not implemented. However, if parse is given ``xhtml=False``, distiller
considers that the underlying host language is pure XML, and these two
additional features are also implemented. An example would be::

    >>> graph.parse('filename.svg', format='rdfa', xhtml=False)
